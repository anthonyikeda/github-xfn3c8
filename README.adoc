== Overview

This is a base for attempting to determine how to use WebAssembly with Angular 9.

First attempt uses the embedded wasm approach where we inlude the built wasm with the Angular app:

* `src/app/assembly/stats_client_wasm_b.wasm`
* `src/app/assembly/stats_client_wasm.js`

The WebAssembly component used is stored here: https://github.com/anthonyikeda/stats-client

Here are some articles and repos that I've been using to try and make this work.
